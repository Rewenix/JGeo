# Overview
A variation on the Geogebra app. 
The aim is to implement frequently used geometric constructions so that they can be used efficiently and viewed clearly.
## Main features
- Basic geometric operations (drawing lines, circles etc.)
- Basic constructions such as parallel/perpendicular lines, angle/perpendicular bisectors, tangents.
- More advanced constructions e.g. circum/incircles, polars, inversions.
- Model of relations between constructed objects allowing for propagation of changes (e.g. moving point around changes lines passing through it)
## Optional features
- A split screen allowing the user to view two versions of a given picture simultaneously - before and after a geometric transformation such as inversion, polar duality, or linear transformation.
- LaTeX (TikZ) export of the picture.
- Tool for creating custom constructions by the user
- Saving/Loading of pictures
